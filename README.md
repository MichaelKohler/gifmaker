This is a prototype gif maker. It supports dropping images from the Desktop (or the File browser of your system) into an area of the page. After that you can click the "Generate GIF" button and you'll get a gif image generated from all the gif images.

##Demo
Go to [demo page](http://michaekohler.github.io/gifmaker) to see it in action!

##Run it locally
Just open the index.html file in your browser. It's as easy as that.

##Contribute
Pull Requests are welcome! Please just make sure, you'll stick to my coding style.
